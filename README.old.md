First thing we need before we can create our own webpage is to setup the tools and packages required. We need to install first a node.js version management utility which can be downloaded from:

https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#readme

After installing the manager. Run the following in your terminal:
```
nvm install lts
```

Note that you cannot install create-react-app when you have an existing virtual environment in target folder.
